PathPlanner files go here.
Save your PathPlanner app "pathplanner" folder into this directory so paths and autos deploy to the robot.
After building autos in the PathPlanner GUI, copy the generated pathplanner folder (with autos/ and paths/) here, or set the app to save to this project's src/main/deploy folder.
